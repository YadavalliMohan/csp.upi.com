<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p style="font-size:20px;">It is a survey conducted to find how many people are using UPI payments in an area. 
For this survey we selected B.V.Nagar village, in SPSR NelloreDistrict. Our main theme is to
know how many people are using UPI payments and the majorpeople using which payment 
app in the area and also explain the advantages of using UPI payments to the people who are
not utilising it. We collected the data from various people and found out how many people
were using UPI payments and the major UPI payment app in that area.
