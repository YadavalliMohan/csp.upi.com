<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
<img src="images\What-is-UPI-and-how-does-it-work-.jpg" >
<p>Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is a system that powers multiple bank accounts into a single 
mobile application (of any participating bank), merging several banking features, seamless fund 
routing & merchant payments into one hood. It also caters to the “Peer to Peer” collect request which 
can be scheduled and paid as per requirement and convenience.</p>
<p>With the above context in mind, NPCI conducted a pilot launch with 21 member banks. The pilot 
launch was on 11th April 2016 by Dr. Raghuram G Rajan, Governor, RBI at Mumbai. Banks have 
started to upload their UPI enabled Apps on Google Play store from 25th August, 2016 onwards.
